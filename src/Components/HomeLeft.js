        <h1>From Principal Desk</h1>
        <p className="font">
          It is indeed a great pleasure for me to mark the presence of Govind
          Ballabh Pant Engineering College (GBPEC) in the highly competitive
          world. It is a matter of immense pride that GBPEC continues to be one
          of the highly sought after institutions affiliated to the Guru Gobind
          Singh Indraprashta University (GGSIPU) for admissions to engineering
          and technology programs. We recognize that the fast growing
          technological developments in all fields are challenging and industry
          requires multi-skilled talent. We have attempted to successfully adapt
          ourselves to this challenge with the active support of the Govt. of
          Delhi incorporating modern infrastructural facilities to craft
          "engineers of tomorrow", with a culture of high sense of dedication,
          determination, discipline and passion. At GBPEC, we believe that the
          sequence of activities must have a positive impact on our students'
          academic and personal development and we are engaged in providing to
          the industry with engineers who would have capabilities to participate
          in the ongoing technological revolution with ease and speed, as well
          as with professionalism and moral values.
        </p>

            ‚ùùAt this fast evolving institute, our focus is on providing an
            ambience conducive to developing a career rather than to just
            getting a job. I am delighted to inform you that, the college has
            earned its place amongst the upcoming institutes of excellence of
            Delhi, with a potential to develop into a world-class centre of
            higher technical education over the coming years. I wish all my
            students, a great success in all their endeavours‚ùû
