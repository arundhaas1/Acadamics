                <p>○ GBPEC draws on a reserve of extraordinary talent as a by-product of its selective, stringent and consequently, amazingly successful to all the UG programmes</p>
                <p>○ The quality of students coming in is, without doubt, the best in the world- drilled in the sciences and problem-solving, the successful candidates are, by default, gifted, dedicated, hard working and blessed with analytical ability. While each one is a ‘topper’, in his/her own right, a leader in more than one sphere of activity, many are consistent toppers at the National Level with various prestigious scholarships and awards and a few even have proved their mettle at the international level, having represented the nation at International Olympiads and other Fairs, Seminars etc.</p>
                <p>○ The pool of talent thus uncovered embraces the best and the brightest from across the length and breadth of the nation. People from the most diverse backgrounds come together in their quest to extend the frontiers of scientific and technological knowledge and in the process forge life-long friendships and inculcate the spirit of teamwork and dedication, which gives them a head start in terms of their careers in the distant corners of the globe.</p>
